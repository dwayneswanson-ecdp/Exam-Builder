    <!-- ABOUT THE BETA / STORY -->
    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>About this beta</h2>

      <p>
        This project started in a very ordinary way: with paper exams that no longer worked.
        Students brought “scratch” notes they passed around, hid phones under the table, and
        turned in answers that were copy–paste identical. At that point, the exam was no longer
        a serious way to measure progress – it was a game of who could outsmart the rules.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of fighting that with more paper, more surveillance and more frustration, I decided
        to build a lightweight online exam space that makes cheating harder and thinking easier.
        The goal is not to catch students, but to design an environment where it’s simply more
        efficient to do the work than to look for loopholes.
      </p>

      <div class="two-col" style="margin-top:1rem;">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>The classroom problem</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Paper exams used 3–4 pages per student and generated a lot of waste.</li>
            <li>Marking stacks of handwritten copies took too long for a quick feedback loop.</li>
            <li>Students coordinated answers via notes and phones despite clear instructions.</li>
            <li>As tools evolved, traditional “no phone, no notes” rules stopped being realistic.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>The design principles</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Students must focus on the content, not on finding ways around the rules.</li>
            <li>The tool must stay straightforward for in-person classes of 15–30 students.</li>
            <li>Instructors should confirm in real time that every exam has been received.</li>
            <li>The technical solution should be lean, without heavy infrastructure.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>What’s included in this beta</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A guided exam creation flow with basic templates so instructors don’t forget key settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Support for QCU/QCM and open-ended questions, suitable for business-school style exams.
        </li>
        <li>
          Time-limited exams with a clear countdown visible to students.
        </li>
        <li>
          Full-screen mode: if the exam window loses focus or the student exits full screen,
          the exam content is erased and the timer keeps running. The message is clear:
          stay focused or lose time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Protection against overlays and extra windows on top of the exam (no hidden tools quietly running over it).
        </li>
        <li>
          No copy–paste in answer fields, even for text sections, to encourage real expression instead of pasting.
        </li>
        <li>
          A login page with passcode protection and a confirmation page so the workflow is explicit for students.
        </li>
        <li>
          Email-based generation: each completed exam is sent directly to the instructor’s inbox,
          who can confirm receipt on the spot before students leave the room.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What’s deliberately not there yet</h3>
      <p>
        For this beta, there is no central storage or full instructor back-office. Exams are not
        stored on a separate server: the platform focuses on generating and securing the exam,
        then sending the result by email. On my side, I still handle some generation steps manually
        while testing the tool with my own classes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Later iterations may add a teacher dashboard and more flexible “unlock” flows
        (for example, allowing an instructor to reopen an exam instead of deleting it),
        but the current version stays intentionally strict and minimal so it can be tested and
        refined in real classrooms first.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re a school or instructor who recognises this situation – too much cheating,
        too much paper, and not enough real evaluation – this beta is a first, pragmatic step
        toward something better.
